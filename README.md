004/100: (Peru Vibe: Twitter Sentiment Analysis in Peru) This project focuses on identifying trending topics on Twitter in Peru and collecting a sample of tweets to estimate the sentiment of the Peruvian population concerning the most relevant events in the country. The sentiment is presented as percentages on a scale from "Very Negative" to "Very Positive". This estimation is performed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, giving a clearer picture of public opinion based on real-time social media data.

## Features
* Access trending tweets from X in Peru.
* Analyze the sentiment of tweets using TextBlob and Google Translate (for a better prediction if tweets are in Spanish).
* Return sentiment results from a 'GET' API as percentages to provide a summary of public sentiment.

## Usage
Note: To use this API, a PRO account for X (Twitter) API v2 is necesary (credentials are available in Twitter Developer Portal).
